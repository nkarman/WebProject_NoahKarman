    "productDescription": "\n\t\t\tFrom his early work with Ozzy Osbourne, to his seminal playing with Black Label Society, to his distinctive solo outings, Zakk Wylde has distinguished himself as one of the most fierce lead players in all of rock. A technique as furious and aggressive demands a guitar to match. Gibson Custom is honored to work with Wylde to create a guitar that features his trademark bullseye graphics, EMG humbucking pickups and raw, unfinished necks. The Zakk Wylde Les Paul from Gibson Custom is the ultimate weapon for guitarists looking to hack out anything from metal to grunge to the most raw shred styles.\t\t",

This deal is  for a Soundcraft SI IMPACT console, Soundcraft 32X16 Mini digital stagebox, 100' digital Cat 6 snake. This lot also includes an Anvil case for the mixer, a reel for the snake, and a SKB rack for the stagebox with a power strip with dimmable lights. The mixer case is an older case I had that shows some wear on the outside but has been completely been re worked with new foam made to fit this mixer and all latches and handles are in solid working condition. I also have a little gig bag that rides in the mixer case on the right side for phones etc. I will also throw in a USB LED goose neck lamp for the console. The SKB case is very nice with no real scuffs etc. all this equipment is absolutely in like new condition and works perfect. I have all the original factory packaging that will also go with it. I will not dig into all the features as you can gather that at the MFG site. I will say that it is with some pain that I am letting go of this, as my real job is now demanding all my time and I do not have time to take on sound jobs. I also have a printed bound version of the manual you may have also. I will say that this is a very nice and fun console to operate. I compared many before buying this and I think it the best sounding of any of them and is the most user friendly. It can be setup any way you wish with any channel or fader on any level or any place on the board, with scribble strips on all inputs and outputs.  The 4 Lexicon FX processors work well. It has all DBX processors Comp, Gate, Limiters, BSS 3rd octave  Eq's. on all outputs and 4 band parametric EQ on each input channel. I will work with you on the shipping. I am in central Ohio and would be willing to make a half way delivery. I really would hate to ship all this but I will if we need to. You may buy with confidence.  I will absolutely guarantee this to be as listed or full refund. NOTE: I am listing this with local pickup. I will help with delivery or shipping. The delivery and shipping we will have to arrange after the sale. I will be fair in shipping rate. I just want it to arrive in the great condition it is. I can put in original boxes and ship if you do not want the board case. This can go UPS. If you want everything  I will pallet and crate it and do truck freight. Again I will be more than fair on shipping and will help with cost to make it fair for both of us. Feel free to ask questions, Thanks and good luck.\t\t",

Purchased about 2 months ago and just getting rid of it because I did not realize that it does not have a channel insert so I can't connect to my compressor. Literally as close as you can get to being brand new. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Comes with all included accessories and documentation. However I don't have the original box.",

Most vocal mixing amplifiers are designed for home use or to work with small KTV boxes, so they usually are built with fewer power amp ICs and are simply unreliable when powering large P.A. speakers. VocoPro had many requests from club KJs for a solid P.A.- style mixing amplifier. Our answer is the HV-1200, a true high power PA vocal mixing amplifier. The HV-1200 utilizes our proven VP-600 PRO power amplifier designed with five-way protection circuitry, making this a high power workhorse. It's also a first class mixer using VocoPro's own DSP Echo / Reverb board for the highest standard in vocal effects. There is even a built in compressor to prevent distortion from excessive vocals on all microphone channels. So if you work hard for your gig, why not get an amplifier that will work as hard as you.\t\t",
